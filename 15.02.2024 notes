PTO have a memory space and address, that memory space is called Registers. UP108) 0×40020000-024002 O3FF All registers for IPAD A have been inside different address space but only are registers

Registers

1.Moder 2.Otyper 3.Ospeedr 4.Pudr 5.Idr 6.Odr 7.Bsrr 8.Lckr 9.Afrl 10.Afrh

MODER Register

Thin the base add

A

base address + off set :0x00

will be A (22)

stari't address will be A

OTYPER Reguter

bare addreis + offset: 0x04

inchaque by

UL>onsigned long

Pheripheral base 140020000 Pheripheral offret Loffred 20000 difference

if both addreas

ard Sarne

then the

(bare address

offset

Pheripheral Bам (periph base + AHBI periph_offlet)

will beg

[GPIOA-offt 0X0000UL

01

Number

GPIOA-BASE (AHBIPERIPH-BASE + GPIO-OFFSET)

when we we the (volatile unsigned int *) then we Call as address

Adtheer

value

The value Can be accessed by POINTER → GPIO A bare address will be > 0x40020000

when we know the base address of GPIOA and we know the offset 0x00 then we can know the place.
