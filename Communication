Serial Communication :
         8-bit data is transferred by one one and bit ae time

Parallel:
         8-bit data is transferred the Some time.

Synchronous:
         They are Data is Synchronize with the clock agree with the clock Speed 

Asynchronous:
         No clock is transmitted. Transmitter & reciever agree on the clock speed for the data transmission (Baudrate).

UART (univeral Asynchronous Reciever /Transmitter):

         It is Serial Communication using both ways it is full duplex.

Duplex:
      It Can be transmitted & recieved

Transmitter Reciever

Reciever ‚Üê Transmitter

Simplex:
       Transmitter Reciever

Half way:
       It can be transmitted in only one way at a time 

Full way:
       It can be transmitted both ways at a time
Parity:
       It is for error detection

Mode:
     Specifies whether it's Rx (or) TX.
